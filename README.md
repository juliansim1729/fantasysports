# fantasysports
A customizable discord bot capable of running a fantasy singles sports league, in the style of a stock market, with the individual unit, whether that be players or teams, fluctuating in 'price' based on their performance. Users of the bot can 'buy' and 'sell' stocks of these players/teams, with the goal being to amass the highest net worth after the designated time frame is over.

Done as part of an individual learning project.
