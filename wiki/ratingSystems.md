# Rating Systems
This serves as a brief primer into the rating systems used within this bot.

## Elo Rating System (ELO)

uses the normal distribution
## Elo Linear Approximation (ELOLinear)

## Glicko-2 Rating System (GLICKO)

## Deutsche Wertungszahl (DWZ)
Deutsche Wertungszahl, or German Evaluation Number in German, is the direct successor to the Ingo System, an early rating system that averaged competitor ratings and subtracted points based on each percentage point above even they did. In the Ingo System, lower numbers were considered to be better, something largely reversed in modern times. After German reunification, the DWZ was introduced as the new chess rating system, a similar, but enhanced version of the now widely common ELO system.

It uses a similar system of comparing actual vs expected point values, but modifies the corresponding static K-factor with a more fluid multiplier, which takes into account games played as well as a 'development coefficient', which was designed to help boost young players' DWZ, but was ignored for the cases of this due to the relative inapplicability of "age" in fantasy leagues. Additionally, it also uses a Gaussian error distribution curve. (cont)
